abstract="Managing privacy and understanding handling of personal data has turned into a fundamental right, at least within the European Union, with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) being enforced since May 25th 2018. This has led to tools and services that promise compliance to GDPR in terms of consent management and keeping track of personal data being processed. The information recorded within such tools, as well as that for compliance itself, needs to be interoperable to provide sufficient transparency in its usage. Additionally, interoperability is also necessary towards addressing the right to data portability under GDPR as well as creation of user-configurable and manageable privacy policies. We argue that such interoperability can be enabled through agreement over vocabularies using linked data principles. The W3C Data Privacy Vocabulary and Controls Community Group (DPVCG) was set up to jointly develop such vocabularies towards interoperability in the context of data privacy. This paper presents the resulting Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV), along with a discussion on its potential uses, and an invitation for feedback and participation.",

abstract="Along with the rapid development of ICT technologies, new areas like Industry 4.0, IoT and 5G have emerged and brought out the need for protecting shared resources and services under time-critical and energy-constrained scenarios with real-time policy-based access control. The process of policy evaluation under these circumstances must be executed within an unobservable delay and strictly comply with security objectives. To achieve this, the policy language needs to be very expressive but lightweight and efficient. Many existing implementations are using XML (Extensible Markup Language) to encode policies, which is verbose, inefficient to parse, and not readable by humans. On the contrary, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text-based and language-independent data-interchange format that is simple for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. Several attempts have emerged to convert existing XML policies and requests into JSON, however, there are very few policy specification proposals that are based on JSON with well-defined syntax and semantics. This paper investigates these challenges, and identifies a set of key requirements for a policy language to optimize the policy evaluation performance. According to these performance requirements, we introduce JACPoL, a descriptive, scalable and expressive policy language in JSON. JACPoL by design provides a flexible and fine-grained ABAC (Attribute-based Access Control), and meanwhile it can be easily tailored to express a broad range of other access control models. This paper systematically illustrates the design and implementation of JACPoL and evaluates it in comparison with other existing policy languages. The result shows that JACPoL can be as expressive as existing ones but more simple, scalable and efficient.",

ABSTRACT = {After the enactment of the GDPR in 2018, many companies were forced to rethink their privacy management in order to comply with the new legal framework. These changes mostly affect the Controller to achieve GDPR-compliant privacy policies and management.However, measures to give users a better understanding of privacy, which is essential to generate legitimate interest in the Controller, are often skipped. We recommend addressing this issue by the usage of privacy preference languages, whereas users define rules regarding their preferences for privacy handling. In the literature, preference languages only work with their corresponding privacy language, which limits their applicability. In this paper, we propose the ConTra preference language, which we envision to support users during privacy policy negotiation while meeting current technical and legal requirements. Therefore, ConTra preferences are defined showing its expressiveness, extensibility, and applicability in resource-limited IoT scenarios. In addition, we introduce a generic approach which provides privacy language compatibility for unified preference matching.},

abstract = {The field of legal Natural Language Processing faces a lot of challenges due to the unavailability of properly structured datasets. One such instance is the need for a dataset that not only separates different parts of legal references, such as an article or paragraph number but also provides information about what a particular legal reference dictates. Having access to such a dataset can provide easy access to researchers working on experiments such as context similarity between law texts and legal cases that refer to a particular law. In this paper, we present a dataset of 2944 legal references in German law that are manually annotated by law experts. This dataset has 21 properties for each law reference in the dataset, such as Buch, Teil, Titel, Untertitel, etc. It also provides the complete text of each law reference in the dataset, along with specific paragraph text mentioned in the law reference. Furthermore, using this dataset together with Open Legal Data, we perform a law reference prediction task to compare the performance between predicting full law reference and only the base law reference.},
